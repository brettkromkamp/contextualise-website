# Getting Started

## Install the Development Version

Contextualise officially supports Python 3.7â€“3.10.

If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system, it is possible to install the development version of Contextualise.

Do:
```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/brettkromkamp/contextualise
    $ cd contextualise
    $ git checkout develop
    $ pip install -e .
```

The ```pip install -e .``` command allows you to follow the development branch as it changes by creating links in the right places and installing the command line scripts to the appropriate locations.

Then, if you want to update Contextualise at any time, in the same directory do:

```bash
    $ git pull
```

[TopicDB](https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db), the topic maps engine on top of which Contextualise is built is regularly updated. However, the version of TopicDB published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/topic-db/) could lag behind. For that reason, it is recommended that you also install TopicDB directly from GitHub:

```bash
    $ pip uninstall topic-db
    $ git clone https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db.git
    $ cd topic-db
    $ git checkout develop
    $ pip install -e .
```

Then, if you want to update TopicDB at any time, in the same directory do:

```bash
    $ git pull
```

Finally, to run the application in **development** mode you need to change to the project's top-level directory and set two environment variables followed by running the ```flask``` command with the ```run``` parameter:

```bash
    $ export FLASK_APP=contextualise
    $ export FLASK_ENV=development
    $ flask run
```

You should see something similar to the following in the terminal:

```
    * Serving Flask app "contextualise" (lazy loading)
    * Environment: development
    * Debug mode: on
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    * Restarting with stat
    * Debugger is active!
    * Debugger PIN: 521-258-444
```

Opening the browser and navigating to ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` should result in showing something similar to the application's *Welcome* page.

Flask's built-in server is not suitable for production purposes. However, it is quite straightforward to run Contextualise using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), a Python [WSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) HTTP server:

```bash
    $ gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 contextualise.wsgi:app
```

For further information for properly running a flask application in production, take a look at Flask's own [documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/#deployment).

## First-Time Use

Several users (with the roles of ```admin``` and ```user```, respectively) are created by the application for testing purposes. To log in as the admin user, provide the following credentials: ```admin@contextualise.dev``` (user name) and ```Passw0rd1``` (password). To log in as a non-admin user, provide the following credentials: ```user@contextualise.dev``` and ```Passw0rd1```.
